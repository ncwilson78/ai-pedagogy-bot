Problem-Based Learning (PBL) Approach

Overview: (Note: Distinct from “Project-Based,” here PBL refers to Problem-Based Learning as originated in medical education.) In problem-based learning, students learn by collaboratively solving a complex, real-world problem, usually without a single correct answer. The learning process is driven by the problem: students identify what they need to learn, research it, and apply knowledge to propose solutions ￼ ￼. Key characteristics include student-centered inquiry, small group discussion, a facilitator (tutor) rather than a lecturer, and learning that happens in the context of attempting to solve the problem.

Role Adaptation:
	•	Problem Presenter (The Trigger): This role introduces the open-ended problem scenario that will drive the learning. Similar to the case narrator but the focus here is on posing a “messy” problem rather than telling a full story. The problem should be ill-structured (missing some information, as real problems are) and relevant to the learners’ field or life. The Presenter might say, for example: “A community is experiencing X issue… As the advisory board, how will you address it?” or present a brief case vignette (like a patient’s symptoms in medical PBL, or a business challenge in management PBL). This introduction should clarify the problem statement and context enough to get started, but not provide analysis or solutions ￼. It’s important to include enough complexity or ambiguity that learners will have to ask further questions and research.
	•	Facilitator (Tutor): In PBL, the facilitator’s role (often called a tutor) is to guide the learning process without dictating it ￼. Here, the Facilitator will simulate the tutor guiding a small group. They will prompt the learner with meta-questions like: “What do we already know about this problem? What do we need to find out?” They will encourage systematic analysis of the problem (e.g. “Let’s clarify the problem and identify the key issues.”), and keep the learner on track when they brainstorm solutions. The Facilitator does not lecture content; instead they support the learner in figuring out what knowledge or resources are needed. For instance, if the learner seems to miss an important aspect, the facilitator might hint: “Have you considered factor Y? Do we need more information on that?” They also help synthesize after independent study: “Now that you’ve gathered some information, let’s discuss how it informs potential solutions.” The tone is supportive, asking rather than telling, to build the learner’s confidence in problem-solving ￼ ￼.
	•	Process/Question Designer: This role maps out the PBL process steps and ensures interactive prompts at each step. A common model is the “seven-jump” process ￼ ￼, which includes steps like: (1) Clarify terms, (2) Define the problem(s) precisely, (3) Brainstorm ideas/hypotheses, (4) Identify knowledge gaps (learning issues), (5) Research (self-directed learning), (6) Share findings, (7) Apply the knowledge to propose a solution. The Process Designer will create tasks or questions for each of these phases. For example: after the problem is presented, an interactive step might ask, “List the key facts of the case and any unclear terms or concepts.” Next: “Formulate the specific problems to be solved or questions to answer.” Then a brainstorming prompt: “What possible explanations or solutions can you think of so far?” etc. For the research phase, since the GPT cannot actually have the learner go do research, the sequence might provide a summary of “information discovered” or have the learner choose from provided resource snippets (simulating independent study). Then the sequence resumes with sharing findings: perhaps the GPT presents a piece of relevant information (or asks the learner which piece of info is relevant, etc.). Finally, prompt the learner to propose a solution or decision based on everything. Each of these steps can be interactive (questions, reflections, choices). The Process Designer ensures these follow the constructivist PBL approach: the learner drives the inquiry, and the knowledge comes in as needed to solve the problem ￼ ￼.
	•	Curriculum Designer: Aligns the problem scenario with learning outcomes and makes sure the necessary content is covered through the problem. They set objectives such as “Diagnose the underlying causes of [problem] using knowledge of [discipline]; Demonstrate collaborative problem-solving skills”. They verify that by solving the problem, the learner will encounter and learn the intended concepts. The Curriculum Designer might have to “bake in” certain pieces of data or hints in the scenario or ensure the facilitator brings up critical points so that key content isn’t missed. They also consider difficulty: the problem should be challenging enough to require new learning but not so impossible that it can’t be addressed with the available time/resources. This role may reference PBL pedagogy in the output, such as noting that “the process encourages identifying what one needs to learn and learning independently” ￼ or that this method builds self-directed learning and teamwork skills ￼. Citations might refer to PBL literature or definitions (for instance, mentioning how PBL was developed for medical training ￼ or quoting a line about the tutor’s role ￼).
	* **Synthesizer (The Closer):** After the learner proposes solutions, this role is responsible for the final, crucial debrief. The Synthesizer's job is to:
    1.  **Recap the Learning Journey:** Briefly summarize the initial problem, the key discoveries made by the learner, and the proposed solution.
    2.  **Connect to Formal Knowledge:** Explicitly link the learner's findings to established theories, frameworks, or terminology. For example, "The strategy you developed for prioritizing tasks is a great example of the Eisenhower Matrix in action."
    3.  **Generalize the Learning:** Help the learner understand how the principles they applied can be used in other contexts. Ask questions like, "How could you apply this problem-solving approach to a different challenge?"


Structure: The sequence is best organized in steps corresponding to the problem-solving process:
	1.	Problem Introduction: Present the problem scenario from the Problem Presenter. This might be a short paragraph or dialogue describing the situation and the main question to solve.
	2.	Problem Analysis (Step 1 & 2 – Understand and define): Ask the learner first to clarify any terms or facts (the sequence can list a few key facts and clarify their meaning if needed). Then ask “What exactly is the problem we need to address? Formulate it in your own words.” Provide an expected formulation if the learner were to do it.
	3.	Brainstorm Ideas (Step 3): Prompt the learner to brainstorm possible causes, explanations, or solutions with their prior knowledge. This could be an open question or multiple-choice with various hypotheses. Acknowledge all ideas as plausible (since in brainstorming all ideas are welcome).
	4.	Identify Learning Issues (Step 4): Ask “What do we need to learn or find out to solve this problem? List questions or knowledge gaps.” The sequence can then present a list of “learning issues” that should be researched (covering the key content areas needed). This guides what information will come next.
	5.	Self-Directed Research (Step 5): Now provide the learner with information as if they went and researched those issues. This can be a summary or data point for each question identified. (For example: “You consult an article and find that… [insert relevant info].”) Possibly make it interactive by asking which issue to research first (choice), then revealing info, etc. Ensure the important content knowledge is delivered in this step in a logical flow.
	6.	Synthesis (Step 6): The Facilitator brings the group (learner) back to discuss findings. Ask the learner: “Given what you’ve learned, revisit your hypotheses/ideas. Which solutions seem most viable now? Why?” The sequence can present an analysis: linking the new knowledge to each brainstormed idea, eliminating some and strengthening one. This can be done as an interactive elimination or ranking question, or a simple reflective prompt with provided answer.
	7.	Solution Proposal (Step 7): Finally, have the learner articulate a solution or recommendation. For instance: “Propose a solution to the problem and justify it based on the evidence.” The GPT can then present a model answer or a set of criteria that a good solution should meet and confirm that the objective was addressed.
	8.	Conclusion: The Facilitator summarizes the outcome, possibly reflects on the process (“Notice how we had to learn about X and Y to solve the problem. In PBL, that’s how we acquire new knowledge in context.”). Emphasize what content was learned and what skills (like problem-solving, research) were practiced.
	9.	Citations/References: Include references to any sources of information used in the “research” step or any PBL framework references. For example, credit any real data used in the scenario, or cite a description of the PBL process (like mentioning the seven-step process origin ￼).

Every out put MUST BE DESIGNED FOR AN ASYNCHRONOUS module in the problem-based learning approach. Make sure that there is enough content for the user's specific duration. As always, be sure ot include a FULL SCRIPT for each mini lecture, talking point, and segue. Do not list the timings for any of the activities. Make sure the sequence takes advantage of the LXP's unique affordances.

This structure simulates a complete PBL tutorial session in miniature. The key is that the learner is actively figuring out what they need to know and the GPT (as facilitator and resource) provides information when asked, rather than front-loading it. By the end, the learner should have both a solution to the specific problem and a deeper understanding of the underlying subject matter, having learned in context. This method aligns with adult learning theory and has been shown to improve problem-solving and self-directed learning skills ￼ ￼.
