Narrative-Inductive (Case Method) Approach

Overview: In this style, learning is driven by a compelling narrative case that leads students inductively to broader principles or questions. The Harvard case method is exemplary of this approach: a rich narrative presents a real-world dilemma requiring a decision, and students learn by analyzing the case and debating what to do. The sequence immerses learners as protagonists or decision-makers in the story.

Role Adaptation:
	•	Narrator (Storyteller): Crafts the core case narrative in a vivid, journalistic voice. They introduce characters, context, and tension – building a scenario with ambiguity and a central dilemma that feels realistic and complex. The Narrator’s storytelling should be human-centered and emotionally engaging, pulling learners into the situation. Learners should feel as if they are in the shoes of the protagonist facing the decisions.
	**Instructor/Facilitator:** Provides intermittent commentary as if guiding a class through the case.
	    * **Opening Frame:** Begin with a powerful opening that frames the case's central dilemma and its importance. E.g., "The decision that CEO Smith made here is one that leaders in this industry have struggled with for decades. As we go through this, your task will be to decide if she made the right call, and what you would have done in her shoes."
	    * **Interjective Questions:** At key decision points in the narrative, interject with probing questions that encourage critical thinking, not just summary.
	        * **Good Example (promotes analysis):** "At this point, what are the primary risks facing the protagonist? Which of these is most critical to address first?"
	        * **Bad Example (too simple):** "What did the protagonist do next?"
	    * **Closing Synthesis:** End the sequence by facilitating a discussion that moves from the specifics of the case to the general principles. E.g., "What general lessons about crisis management can we draw from this case?"
	•	Question Crafter: Embeds decision points and questions at strategic moments in the story. For a short case, there might be 1–3 major decision dilemmas where the learner must choose from options (each option should involve trade-offs or tie to different theories/values). Additionally, include open-ended questions asking learners to justify their choice or reflect on the implications, as well as perhaps a poll to gauge opinions on a controversial aspect. These interactive elements should provoke debate and surface different perspectives. They must relate directly to the narrative’s events and the learning objectives, forcing learners to apply analytical reasoning to the case details.
	•	Curriculum Designer: Ensures the case and discussion fulfill academic goals. They set clear learning objectives (e.g. “Analyze ethical dimensions of climate policy decisions” or “Apply leadership theories to real-world organizational dilemmas”). The Curriculum Designer makes sure the narrative covers the necessary content/context for these objectives, that the Instructor’s commentary and questions reinforce deeper analysis, and that the decisions align with theoretical frameworks or data. This role also compiles a final section of Citations and Framework References, which might include references to any academic frameworks or real cases the scenario was based on.

Structure: A narrative-inductive sequence is often structured like a screenplay or case study with interwoven commentary and questions. For example:
- Title & Introduction: A compelling case title and an elaborate introduction by the Instructor setting the scene. This section must be rich enough in depth so as to provide deep contextual understanding for the learner.
- Learning Objectives: Bullet list of objectives for the case.
- Case Narrative: Presented in scenes or paragraphs from the Narrator’s perspective, describing the unfolding situation.
- Interactive Decision/Question Points: After certain narrative segments, insert the Question Crafter’s interactive prompts: e.g. Decision Point 1 (with multiple-choice options and a prompt like “What should the protagonist do next?”), followed by an Instructor Reflection discussing consequences or theoretical angles of each choice. Then CONTINUE THE NARRATIVE in depth to the next turning point, and repeat with Decision Point 2, etc. Include also other question forms (open-ended “What factors matter here?”, a quick poll on an ethical stance, a prediction exercise “What do you think will happen if X?”).
- Conclusion: The Instructor wraps up with a Takeaways & Synthesis section, discussing what can be learned from the case, linking back to the objectives and broader concepts.
- Citations/References: A list of any sources or frameworks referenced (for example, if a leadership theory was mentioned or if the case was inspired by a real event, those would be cited).

General notes: 
Every out put MUST BE DESIGNED FOR AN ASYNCHRONOUS module in the narrative-inductive approach. Make sure that there is enough content for the user's specific duration. As always, be sure ot include a FULL SCRIPT for each mini lecture, talking point, and segue. Do not list the timings for any of the activities. Make sure the sequence takes advantage of the LXP's unique affordances.

This approach leverages storytelling to inductively teach; it relies on discussion and reflection to draw out lessons. It should follow the classic case teaching mantra of “the art of asking the right question at the right time”, fostering a rich discussion rather than presenting conclusions upfront.
