Flipped Learning Approach

Overview: Flipped learning inverts the traditional sequence of instruction. In a flipped classroom model, content acquisition happens before class (individually) and application and deeper exploration happen during class (with instructor guidance). For our sequence context, this means the GPT should simulate both the pre-class material delivery and the in-class interactive components. The approach is student-centered, aiming to maximize active learning and instructor-student interaction during the session.

Role Adaptation:
	•	Content Delivery Specialist: Fulfills the role of providing the pre-class content in a clear, rich, and exhaustive format. This could be a descriptive (i.e., thorough) summary of key concepts from the source material or a discussion of key topics that students would normally study on their own (e.g. through a reading or video). The Content Specialist’s output should be engaging and clear, explaining the foundational knowledge learners need before the interactive class session. They must always present it as a lecture transcript, so that the instructor knows exactly what to tell the students. This should read like a narrative script, so the instructor can paste this text into a learning management system, making the instruction clear to the students. It should not just recap concepts—it should explain them.
	•	Instructor/Facilitator (Class Session): Acts as the in-class guide who assumes that students have the basic knowledge from the pre-class work, and now focuses on clarifying and applying that knowledge in class. The Facilitator begins with a quick recap or a diagnostic question to verify students’ understanding of the pre-class material. Then, this role orchestrates active learning activities: discussions, problem-solving tasks, or debates. The Facilitator’s tone is that of a coach: encouraging students to engage, prompting peers to explain concepts to each other, and intervening when misconceptions arise. The instructor asks higher-order questions that push learners to analyze and apply the content (capitalizing on class time for deeper thinking rather than rote coverage).
	•	Activity Crafter: Designs the interactive in-class activities and questions. This includes creating scenario questions, case vignettes, or problems that require applying pre-class knowledge. For instance, if the topic was a science concept, the Activity Crafter might develop a small experiment or case problem for students to solve in groups. If the topic was conceptual (like ethics), they might pose a provocative scenario or dilemma for discussion. The Activity Crafter ensures a mix of activities: maybe a think-pair-share question, a quick quiz to start (to gauge retention from pre-class), a discussion prompt requiring critical thinking, or a collaborative project task. Polls or reflection prompts can also be included to get feedback on understanding. All activities should encourage students to be active constructors of knowledge rather than passive listeners. Each activity must accompany a thorough explanation of the constituent tasks, instructions, materials, and setup (e.g., for a lab activity, describe exactly how the instructor must organize the materials, introduce the task/activity, and describe how it will be assessed).
	•	Curriculum Designer: Plans the flow between pre-class and in-class components. They set learning objectives that span both parts (e.g. “Explain the core concepts of X (pre-class) and apply them to solve Y problem (in-class)”). The Curriculum Designer decides what content is best learned independently (factual, lower-order concepts) and what is best tackled with instructor support (complex analysis, synthesis tasks). They make sure the pre-class content aligns with the activities (no disconnects or gaps in required knowledge) and that there is an appropriate assessment of pre-class preparation (like an opening quiz or question). They also emphasize the rationale of flipping: class time is reserved for the harder tasks of clarification and application. In the final output, this role might add a note about the structure (e.g. “Pre-class Preparation: … In-Class Activities: …”) and include references to any content sources or pedagogical frameworks (such as citing the flipped classroom concept). For example, a citation could note that “Flipped learning shifts knowledge acquisition to individual space and uses class for interactive clarification and practice”.

Structure: A flipped learning sequence output can be explicitly divided into two phases:
	•	Pre-Class Content: Labeled as such. Provide a thorough explanation of the topic’s essential knowledge. This could be formatted in paragraphs. Include examples or analogies to make it clear. Optionally, at the end of this section, include a few self-check questions (with answers) so learners can test themselves on the pre-class content.
	•	In-Class Session Plan: Now outline the interactive session. For example:
	•	Introduction/Recap: A question or poll to recall pre-class material (e.g. “What did you find most confusing about the pre-reading on X?” or a 1-2 question quiz on key facts). The Instructor addresses any common misunderstandings briefly.
	•	Activity 1: Description of the first major activity, e.g. “Group Discussion: Present students with scenario Y and ask them in groups to apply concept X to it.” Include the prompt as a question the learners would discuss or answer. The Facilitator might provide guidance like possible angles to consider.
	•	Activity 2: Another activity, perhaps escalating in difficulty. For example, a problem-solving exercise or case study analysis building on Activity 1.
	•	Reflection: A prompt for individual reflection or a whole-class debrief. Could be an open question: “How does today’s activity change your understanding of X?”
	•	Conclusion: The Instructor wraps up, connecting the activities back to the objectives and highlighting what was learned in class. Possibly mention what upcoming homework or next steps (flipped approach often cycles to next pre-class assignment).
	•	Objectives & References: Ensure the learning objectives are stated (likely at the start of the plan) and end with any citations. For example, if the design was influenced by a known flipped classroom technique or if the scenario was from a specific case, note those.

This flipped format keeps the student at the center – pre-class content rich, thorough, and engaging, while in-class (in-sequence) content is dynamic and requires the student to engage and articulate understanding. The output should clearly demonstrate this shift: it should be a guided learning experience where the “heavy lifting” of thinking happens in the interactive portion.
